      <p>This is a Banner element, and it's generally used as an introduction or opening statement. You can customize
        its style, scheme, color, size, orientation, content alignment, and image position, as well as assign it an
        optional onload or onscroll transition modifier (details).</p>

      <p>This is a Spotlight element, and it's generally used – as its name implies – to spotlight a particular feature,
        subject, or pretty much whatever. You can customize its style, scheme, color, orientation, content alignment,
        and image position, as well as assign it an optional onload or onscroll transition modifier (details).</p>

      <p>This is also a Spotlight element, and it's here because this demo would look a bit empty with just one
        spotlight. Like all spotlights, you can customize its style, scheme, color, orientation, content alignment, and
        image position, as well as assign it an optional onload or onscroll transition modifier (details).</p>

      <p>And yes, this is another Spotlight element, and it's also here because I need to fill a bit of space.
        Naturally, like any other spotlight, you can customize its style, scheme, color, orientation, content alignment,
        and image position, as well as assign it an optional onload or onscroll transition modifier (details).</p>

      lightbox class),
      and you can customize its
      style and size, as well as assign it an optional onload or onscroll transition modifier (details).</p>
